# Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS) Pipeline Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the workflow and output documentation for the DNA-seq pipeline executed on the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud platform as part of the HIDS-7003-01 course. The analysis focused on Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS) data from two patients from the Personal Genome Project (PGP) in the UK.

## Pipeline Execution
- **Pipeline Used**: DNA-seq
- **Batch Job Details**: The workflow was run as a batch job, processing data from two WXS patients.
- **Data Location**: Data for this analysis was sourced from "Seven Bridges > Files > WXSandWGS > PGP_UK_WXS_homework_question".

## Repository Contents
### Execution Summary
- `AizhanUteubayeva_WXS_HW_summary.docx`: A document summarizing the execution of the pipeline, including:
  - Screenshots of the batch job setup and completion.
  - A detailed list and description of the output files.
  - Execution time and cost details.

### Output Files
- The output files have been organized into a folder named "StudentName_WXS_HW_output" on the Seven Bridges platform. This repository includes references to these outputs as documented in the summary.

## Comparison Analysis
- **Comparison Table**: The summary document includes a comparison of RNA-seq, WGS, and WXS pipelines, detailing input and output file formats, sizes, and pipeline execution durations.

### Conclusions from Comparison
- The comparison highlights the computational demands and outputs of each sequencing pipeline, providing insights into the efficiencies and data yields from RNA-seq, WGS, and WXS methods.

## How to Use This Repository
- Review the `AizhanUteubayeva_WXS_HW_summary.docx` for a comprehensive understanding of the pipeline execution and output analysis.
- The comparison table within the summary document offers a critical evaluation of different genomic sequencing workflows, useful for academic and research purposes.
